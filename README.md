#Flash Cards

Build a front-end flashcards app. It should be React.js and does not need a back-end, it can re-initialize on each launch or store in local storage, either would be perfectly fine. You may want to consider Redux for persistence but this is not required. We don’t care about the design, we have a design team that provides us with design files, you should focus more of your time on proper code organization and architecture. I have included some screenshots of the flashcards feature in Bookshelf for reference.


Your application should allow a user to create flashcard decks, those decks have cards, those cards have a front and a back. If you want to go beyond that and allow for “know it” / “don’t know it” triggers, that would be great but not required. For submission, either post to a public github repo or just send us a zip file. Please don’t spend more than two days on this project, it can have bugs, it does not need to be perfect. Let us know what day you think you can have it done by, it’s fine if that day is next week. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
