# Flash Cards

Welcome to Flashcards!

This simple application allows users to create, edit, and view flashcards to help with learning.

# Installation & Setup

Fork & Clone this repo.
CD into the project file.
$ npm install
$ npm start

# Features & Use

There is already one small deck loaded into the app upon initialization.

Click on the arrow towards the bottom of a deck to practice it in quiz mode.

Click on the plus sign at the top of the sidebar to create a new deck. Click the title area to update the decks title, and click save.

Click on the add cards button of a deck to create new cards in that deck, click the plus sign at the top to create a new card, and the pencil on the card to give it content on the front and back. If you do not add content to a card, it will not be saved.

While editing a card's content, the swap button in the middle will flip the front and the back of the card. 

You can also click the play button at the top of a deck to enter quiz mode, or press stop to end the quiz. The Home button top left will also end the quiz and bring you back to your decks.

Click on a trashcan to delete a card or a deck.

Decks and cards persist through local storage, so there is a small button bottom right to simply clear local storage and re-initialize the application.



Thank you SO much for your time, and I look forward to connecting with you again soon!
