# Flash Cards

Welcome to "Flashers" - a flashcards application. 

This application allows users to create, edit, and view flashcards to help with learning.

# Features & Use

- There is already one small deck loaded into the app upon initialization.

- Click on the arrow towards the bottom of a deck to practice it in quiz mode.

- Click on the plus sign at the top of the sidebar to create a new deck. Click the title area to update the decks title, and click save.

- Click on the add cards button of a deck to create new cards in that deck, click the plus sign at the top to create a new card, and the pencil on the card to give it content on the front and back. If you do not add content to a card, it will not be saved.

- While editing a card's content, the swap button in the middle will flip the front and the back of the card. 

- You can also click the play button at the top of a deck to enter quiz mode, or press stop to end the quiz. The Home button top left will also end the quiz and bring you back to your decks.

- Click on a trashcan to delete a card or a deck.

- Decks and cards persist through local storage, so there is a small button bottom right to simply clear local storage and re-initialize the application.
